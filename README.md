# MachineLearning_HumsAndWhistles
The mini-project consists of two components:

1.   **Basic solution**: Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a Potter or a StarWars audio segment and predicts its song label (either Harry or StarWars).   
2.   **Advanced solution**: There are two options. (i) Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model. (ii) Create a product that uses the functionality provided by a model trained on the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset (e.g. a simple App that predicts the label Harry or StarWars when you hum to it).
